### Installation  💾
You’ll need to use the [MySQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) and [Sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize) packages to connect your Express.js API to a MySQL database and the [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) package to use environment variables to store sensitive data. The application will be invoked by using the following command:

```bash
  npm install
```
Open MySQL by the following command line:
```bash
  mysql -u root -p
```
From there you will enter the next command line: 
```bash
  source db/schema.sql
``` 

Exit MySQL shell seed the database with the following command line: 
```bash
  node seeds/index.js  
```
or
```bash
  npm seed
```
Finally you will enter the last command to connect to the server: 
```bash
  npm start
```


### Usage ⚡
This application does not have front-end built, but it allows you to test routes and their functionality using Insomina.
